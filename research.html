            <h3><i><b>GOGOVAN</b></i></h3>
            <p>Established in 2013, GOGOVAN is the first app-based
                platform for delivering goods in Asia, which is dedicated
                in offering excellent delivery service through innovative technology.
                Since then, GOGOVAN has extended its service to various platforms.
                The company connects individuals and businesses directly to
                thousands of drivers for their real-time delivery needs, and redefines
                the everyday delivery experience by providing a convenient and
                efficient service. Over the years, GOGOVAN has expanded its business
                from Hong Kong to Singapore, South Korea, Mainland China, Taiwan and
                India and will continue to expand globally. In August 2017, GOGOVAN
                merged with 58 Suyun, the leader in Mainland China’s intra-city
                logistics market, and increased GOGOVAN’s presence to over 300 cities,
                with more than 8 million registered drivers under its network.</p>

            <h3><i><b>WiFi big data analysis in Macau</b></i></h3>
            <p>In this project, we focus on the five phases of the WiFi big data
                in Macau, i.e., data storage, data mining, data analysis, strategies
                and visualization. We utilize WiFi big data to: 1) categorize resident,
                commuter and tourist into groups, and then model spatiotemporal
                trajectories of tourists for semantic mining; 2) identify characteristics
                and preferences of different individuals and groups; 3) understand the
                experience of tourists in real-world tourism activities, and Virtual space
                experience through WiFi connection; 4) Develop personalized travel
                recommendation service and management system based on Internet geographic
                information. We finally make a geodatabase to support Web GIS and data mining,
                a Web GIS-based platform for visualization and analytics and data mining
                algorithms to provide a customizable solution.</p>

            <h3><i><b>Wildfire Detection System</b></i></h3>
            <p> This project aims to develop a versatile, user-friendly, highly
                integrated data and analytical Geomantic Information System (GIS)
                software platform for disaster monitoring, analysis and prediction.
                To achieve the objective above, the project team will leverage on the
                combined expertise from Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) in GIS,
                spatial data analysis algorithm and modeling together with the advanced
                natural resource monitoring technology from Insight Robotics comprising
                robotics control and UAV system in aerial survey. The desired outcome is
                a platform to improve decision making through disaster monitoring using
                multi-directional visualization system incorporating various data overlay
                to enable visualization in a multi-factored reality; & disaster prediction
                based on trends generated from data mining and fusion combined with spatial
                data analysis/modeling algorithms.</p>

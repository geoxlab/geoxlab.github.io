                    Established in 2013, GOGOVAN is the first app-based
                    platform for delivering goods in Asia, which is dedicated
                    in offering excellent delivery service through innovative technology.
                    Since then, GOGOVAN has extended its service to various platforms.
                    The company connects individuals and businesses directly to
                    thousands of drivers for their real-time delivery needs, and redefines
                    the everyday delivery experience by providing a convenient and
                    efficient service. Over the years, GOGOVAN has expanded its business
                    from Hong Kong to Singapore, South Korea, Mainland China, Taiwan and
                    India and will continue to expand globally. In August 2017, GOGOVAN
                    merged with 58 Suyun, the leader in Mainland China’s intra-city
                    logistics market, and increased GOGOVAN’s presence to over 300 cities,
                    with more than 8 million registered drivers under its network.<br>

                    In this project, we focus on the five phases of the WiFi big data
                in Macau, i.e., data storage, data mining, data analysis, strategies
                and visualization. We utilize WiFi big data to: 1) categorize resident,
                commuter and tourist into groups, and then model spatiotemporal
                trajectories of tourists for semantic mining; 2) identify characteristics
                and preferences of different individuals and groups; 3) understand the
                experience of tourists in real-world tourism activities, and Virtual space
                experience through WiFi connection; 4) Develop personalized travel
                recommendation service and management system based on Internet geographic
                information. We finally make a geodatabase to support Web GIS and data mining,
                a Web GIS-based platform for visualization and analytics and data mining
                algorithms to provide a customizable solution.<br>

                combined expertise from Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) in GIS,
                spatial data analysis algorithm and modeling together with the advanced
                natural resource monitoring technology from Insight Robotics comprising
                robotics control and UAV system in aerial survey. The desired outcome is
                a platform to improve decision making through disaster monitoring using
                multi-directional visualization system incorporating various data overlay
                to enable visualization in a multi-factored reality; & disaster prediction

                    Based on the concepts of isovists and medial axes, we developed a set of algorithms that can automatically generate axial lines 
		    for representing individual linearly stretched parts of open space of an urban environment. Open space is the space between buildings, 
		    where people can freely move around. The generation of the axial lines has been a key aspect of space syntax research, conventionally 
		    relying on hand-drawn axial lines of an urban environment, often called axial map, for urban morphological analysis. 
		    Although various attempts have been made towards an automatic solution, few of them can produce the axial map that consists of the 
		    least number of longest visibility lines, and none of them really works for different urban environments. Our algorithms provide a 
		    better solution than existing ones. Throughout this paper, we have also argued and demonstrated that the axial lines constitute a true
		    skeleton, superior to medial axes, in capturing what we perceive about the urban environment.<br>
